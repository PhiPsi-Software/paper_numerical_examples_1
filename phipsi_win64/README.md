# 1. Introduction to PhiPsi_Win64.exe.

## 1.1 Introduction.

PhiPsi is a computational solid mechanics program, which involves the eXtended Finite Element Method (XFEM) as well as the Finite Element Method (FEM). The program is written in Fortran and compiled using the GNU Fortran compiler (gfortran 13). The program is named PhiPsi because $\phi$ and $\psi$ are the basic variables for the level set method which is widely used in the XFEM. On the other hand, $\phi$ and $\psi$ donate the internal friction angle and the dilation angle in the plastic theory.

PhiPsi was initially developed in order to solve problems involve defects such as cracks, voids, and inclusions. Now, the problems which can be solved by PhiPsi include:
* 2D static FEM analysis (without defects) with elastic and plastic materials.
* 3D static FEM analysis (without defects) with elastic materials.
* 2D static XFEM analysis with elastic materials, arbitrary number and kinds of defects including cracks, voids and inclusions.
* 3D static XFEM analysis with elastic materials and crack.
* 2D hydraulic fracturing analysis with elastic materials and initial natural fracture.
* 3D hydraulic fracturing analysis with elastic materials and initial natural fracture.
* 2D implicit dynamic FEM and XFEM analysis, including earthquake analysis.
* 2D explicit dynamic FEM and XFEM analysis, including earthquake analysis.
* 3D explicit dynamic FEM and XFEM analysis, including earthquake analysis.
* 2D static field problem analysis, including temperature field, fluid pressure field, etc.
* 2D dynamic field problem analysis, including temperature field, fluid pressure field, etc.
* Molecular dynamics analysis.
* Peri-dynamics analysis.

The data generated by PhiPsi can be post processed by a Post-Processor program written in Matlab. You can download the latest version of executable PhiPsi for the windows platform, the source codes of an earlier version of PhiPsi, the source codes of the Matlab Post-Processor, and some other tools from http://phipsi.top/downloads.html.

## 1.2 Functions and features of PhiPsi.

* Supported analysis type: 2D and 3D static analysis, 2D and 3D hydraulic fracturing analysis, 2D and 3D dynamic analysis, and 2D field problem analysis.
* Support as many as 1000 fractures, voids, and inclusions.
* Randomly generating initial fractures, voids, and inclusions.
* Intersection of 2D and 3D fractures, intersection of fracture and voids or inclusion.

# 3. Usage and running the test.

## 3.1 How does PhiPsi work?

There are two options to use PhiPsi.

### 3.1.1 OPTION 1 -- Use ANSYS (or Abaqus etc) and Matlab for pre-processing and post-processing, respectively.
The input files of PhiPsi include a keywords file and other data files contain the node coordinates ( *.node), element-node information ( *.elem), boundary conditions ( *.boux and *.bouy), and external forces ( *.focx and *.focy). The keywords file ( *.kpp) defines information such as the work directory, analysis type, coordinates of initial cracks. The data files can be generated automatically by run the macro file called Ansys2PhiPsi_2D.mac for 2D problems or Ansys2PhiPsi_3D.mac for 3D problems once the model is created in ANSYS. Certainly, you can define the data files by using other software such as Abaqus or just generate it manually.
    
Once PhiPsi (PhiPsi_Win64.exe) starts, it will check all the input files firstly. After the analysis, the output files will be saved to the working directory. A Matlab-based program (all the source codes are available for download, see "The source codes of the Post-Processor written in Matlab" on page http://phipsi.top/downloads.html) is offered for post-processing. A tutorial (a pdf file) is available on the downloads page (see "The tutorial" on page http://phipsi.top/downloads.html).

This document describes only OPTION 1.

### 3.1.2 OPTION 2 -- Use PhiPsi GUI
Alternatively, you can also perform an analysis using PhiPsi GUI (PhiPsi Graphical User Interface). Within PhiPsi GUI, you can directly create the geometric model, apply boundary conditions and external force, perform meshing, edit keywords file, call PhiPsi Fortran kernel, plot deformed mesh, plot contours, etc. However, the current version of PhiPsi GUI is still in the beta channel, some functions are not available yet. Therefore, Option 1, i.e., pre-processing using ANSYS and post-processing using Matlab is suggested. PhiPsi GUI is available on the downloads page, see "PhiPsi GUI - Graphical User Interface for PhiPsi" on page http://phipsi.top/downloads.html). It should be noted that both option to use PhiPsi call the same Fortran Kernel named as PhiPsi_Win64.exe.
	  

## 3.2 How to use PhiPsi_Win64.exe with specified keywords file(s) (*.kpp)?

There are three options to use PhiPsi_Win64.exe with specified keywords file.

### 3.2.1 OPTION 1 -- Double-click PhiPsi_Win64.exe
Double-click PhiPsi_Win64.exe, when asked for enter the name of the keywords file, then do it and press Enter button. If the keywords file, i.e., the *.kpp file is in the same folder as PhiPsi_Win64.exe, then you need only enter the name of kpp file without directory.
	  
After the analysis, you can use the Post-Processor written in Matlab to perform the post-processing. Post-Processor can be downloaded from http://phipsi.top/downloads.html (see "The source codes of the Post-Processor written in Matlab").
	
### 3.2.2 OPTION 2 -- using Windows CMD (together with CD command)
Open Windows terminal, use CD command to change directory to the folder which contains PhiPsi_Win64.exe, then enter PhiPsi_Win64.exe and press Enter button, and then enter the kpp file just as what you should do in OPTION 1.

Alternatively, your can run PhiPsi by typing a command line as follows:
~~~bash
PhiPsi_Win64.exe -i "X:\PhiPsi Work\FEM.kpp" -n 4
~~~
where -i specifies the file path of the keywords file (*.kpp), and -n specify the number of threads for the OpenMP parallel simulation.
	
### 3.2.3 OPTION 3 -- using Windows batch script (*.bat file)
New a *.txt file in the folder which contains PhiPsi_Win64.exe and rename it as *.bat. Edit this bat file just as follows:

~~~bash
echo Staring test1...
start  /wait "" "PhiPsi_Win64.exe" -i FEM.kpp -n 2
echo Staring test2...
start  /wait "" "PhiPsi_Win64.exe" -i XFEM.kpp -n 2
~~~~    

Double-click this bat file to run synchronously FEM.kpp and XFEM.kpp. If you want to run sequentially, then you just need to edit the bat file as:

~~~bash    
echo Staring test1...
start  "" "PhiPsi_Win64.exe" -i FEM.kpp -n 2
echo Staring test2...
start  "" "PhiPsi_Win64.exe" -i XFEM.kpp -n 2	
~~~~ 

# 4. Files of PhiPsi.

### 4.3.4 *.disp_i
This file stores displacements of nodes generated at load step $i$. For 2D problems, the file format is ($u_x$ of node $i$; $u_y$ of node $i$; $u_x$ of node $i+1$; $u_y$ of node $i+1$). For example, if the following lines are line 7 to 10, then $u_x$ of node 4 is -0.466896194407E-05, $u_y$ of node 4 is 0, $u_x$ of node 5 is -0.566032590142E-07, and $u_y$ of node 5 is 0.
